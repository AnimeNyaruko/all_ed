# Progress: Assignment Submission Handler

## What Works

### Core Functionality

1. **Server-Side**

   - [x] Task fetching from database
   - [x] Session management
   - [x] Cookie handling
   - [x] Basic error handling

2. **Client-Side**

   - [x] Split-pane layout (using CSS Grid)
   - [x] Resizable panels (handle needs verification)
   - [x] Content rendering (Markdown, basic KaTeX)
   - [x] Responsive design basics
   - [x] Timer functionality (Start/Pause/Stop)
   - [x] Modern header
   - [x] Independent panel scrolling (including left-side scrollbar for left panel)

3. **Content Management & Editing**

   - [x] Markdown support (via `react-markdown`)
   - [x] Basic LaTeX math rendering (via `rehype-katex`)
   - [x] Lexical editor foundation (`AnswerArea.tsx`, `QuestionEditorInstance.tsx`)
   - [x] Custom `LatexNode` for representing LaTeX in Lexical.
   - [x] External MathLive (`<math-field>`) integration for LaTeX input.
   - [x] `!!` trigger to open MathLive for inserting _new_ LaTeX nodes.
   - [x] `Ctrl+Q` shortcut trigger to open MathLive for inserting _new_ LaTeX nodes.
   - [x] Single MathLive instance enforcement (scrolls & focuses existing if attempt to open another).
   - [x] Editor instance disabled (`readOnly`) while its MathLive input is active.
   - [x] Editor placeholder updated with `!!` and `Ctrl+Q` instructions.
   - [ ] Click-to-edit existing `LatexNode`s (partially implemented, needs verification).

4. **User Interface**
   - [x] Clean, modern design
   - [x] Timer controls visible in header
   - [x] FontAwesome icons

   - Logging needs implementation

2. **Client-Side**

   - UI responsiveness issues
   - Timer state persistence needed

## Next Steps

### Planned Features / Verification

1. **Testing & Verification**

   - [ ] Test `Ctrl+Q` shortcut thoroughly.
   - [ ] Test single MathLive instance focus/scroll behavior.
   - [ ] Test editor disabling during MathLive input.
   - [ ] Verify independent scrolling works robustly with various content lengths.
   - [ ] Test `ResizableBox` handle with the Grid layout. Address if needed.
   - [ ] Implement/verify click-to-edit for existing `LatexNode`s.

2. **UI/UX Refinements**

   - [ ] Add visual styling to `LatexNode`.
   - [ ] Refine error handling for MathLive.

3. **Longer Term**
   - [ ] Timer state persistence.
   - [ ] Optimize editor performance if needed.

## Testing Status

- Layout scrolling seems fixed, needs more thorough testing.
- `Ctrl+Q` shortcut implemented, needs testing.
- Single MathLive focus/scroll logic implemented, needs testing.
- Editor disabling implemented, needs testing.
- `!!` trigger functionality tested previously.
- Click-to-edit needs implementation/testing.
- Timer functionality partially tested.

5. **Maintenance**
   - [x] Reviewed dependencies and removed unused packages (`@mui/material`, `better-react-mathjax`, `bezier-easing`, `jquery`, `mathjs`, `@types/jquery`).
