# Progress: Assignment Submission Handler

## What Works

### Core Functionality

1. **Server-Side**

   - [x] Task fetching from database
   - [x] Session management
   - [x] Cookie handling
   - [x] Basic error handling

2. **Client-Side Layout & Base UI**

   - [x] Split-pane layout (using CSS Grid)
   - [x] Independent panel scrolling (including left-side scrollbar)
   - [x] Responsive design basics
   - [x] Timer functionality (Start/Pause/Stop controls & display)
   - [x] Modern header
   - [x] Resizable left panel (using custom ghost drag logic - see System Patterns)

3. **Content Management & Math Editor**

   - [x] Markdown support (`react-markdown` in question view)
   - [x] Basic LaTeX math rendering (`rehype-katex` in question view)
   - [x] Lexical editor foundation (`AnswerArea.tsx`, `QuestionEditorInstance.tsx`)
   - [x] Custom `LatexNode` for representing LaTeX in Lexical.
   - [x] Inline rendering of `LatexNode` using `react-katex` (`LatexComponent`).
   - [x] External MathLive (`<math-field>`) integration for dedicated LaTeX input.
   - [x] `!!` trigger to open MathLive for inserting _new_ LaTeX nodes (`LatexTriggerPlugin`).
   - [x] `Ctrl+Q` shortcut trigger to open MathLive for inserting _new_ LaTeX nodes (`MathShortcutPlugin`).
   - [x] Single MathLive instance enforcement (scrolls & focuses existing if attempt to open another) (`useMathLiveManager`).
   - [x] Editor instance disabled (`readOnly`) while its MathLive input is active (`QuestionEditorInstance`).
   - [x] Editor placeholder updated with `!!` and `Ctrl+Q` instructions.
   - [ ] Click-to-edit existing `LatexNode`s (Needs implementation/verification).

## Recently Completed (Reflects `activeContext.md`)

1. **Math Editor Interaction Enhancements**

   - Added `Ctrl+Q` shortcut trigger.
   - Implemented single MathLive instance logic (focus/scroll existing).
   - Implemented editor disabling (`readOnly`) during MathLive input.
   - Updated editor placeholder text.

2. **Layout Refactor & Scrolling Fixes**

   - Replaced Flexbox with CSS Grid for main layout.
   - Implemented robust independent panel scrolling.
   - Implemented left-side scrollbar using `direction: rtl/ltr`.
   - Fixed page-level scrolling issues with global styles.

3. **Dependency Cleanup**

   - Removed several unused dependencies (listed in previous `progress.md`).

4. **Performance Optimization (Resize Lag)**

   - [x] Replaced `ResizableBox` with a custom drag handling mechanism.
   - [x] Implemented a "ghost bar" effect: Handle remains stationary during drag, only a visual indicator moves. Layout updates only on drag end (`mouseup`/`touchend`).
   - [x] Achieved smooth resizing performance even under heavy load conditions.

5. **Code Quality (Linting)**

   - [x] Removed unnecessary `eslint-disable` directives identified by the linter.
   - [x] Verified code passes `pnpm run lint` without errors or warnings.

## Known Issues / Items Requiring Verification

1. **Click-to-Edit:** The workflow for clicking an existing `LatexNode` to open MathLive needs full implementation and verification.
2. **Visual Styling:** `LatexNode` currently lacks distinct visual styling within the editor.
3. **Cursor/Selection:** Robustness of cursor positioning and selection handling around `LatexNode` after insertion/editing needs testing.
4. **Timer Persistence:** Timer state is not persistent across page reloads/navigation (Lower priority for now).
5. **MathLive Initial Display:** (From todo.txt) MathLive component (`<math-field>`) doesn't appear initially when triggered (`!!`, `Ctrl+Q`) due to `overflow: hidden` in `lambai.tsx`. Requires a permanent CSS solution (Positioning/Z-index, Portal, or Layout Refactor).

## Next Steps (Immediate Tasks)

1. **Fix MathLive Initial Display:**

   - [ ] Investigate and implement a solution for the `overflow: hidden` issue preventing MathLive from showing (See Known Issues #5).

2. **Verification & Implementation:**

   - [ ] Implement/verify click-to-edit functionality for existing `LatexNode`s.

3. **Refinement:**

   - [ ] Add visual styling to `LatexNode` (e.g., background, border) to make it distinct.

4. **Thorough Testing (Post-Fixes):**
   - [ ] Test MathLive display fix in various scenarios.
   - [ ] Test click-to-edit functionality.
   - [ ] Retest core editor interactions (`!!`, `Ctrl+Q`, typing, etc.) to ensure no regressions.

## Upcoming / Longer Term

- [ ] Refine error handling for MathLive loading and interaction.
- [ ] Address Timer state persistence if required.
- [ ] Optimize editor performance if necessary with complex content.

## Testing Status

- Layout scrolling seems fixed, needs more thorough testing.
- `Ctrl+Q` shortcut implemented, needs testing.
- Single MathLive focus/scroll logic implemented, needs testing.
- Editor disabling implemented, needs testing.
- `!!`
