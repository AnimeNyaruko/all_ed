# Progress: Assignment Submission Handler

## What Works

### Core Functionality

1. **Server-Side**

   - [x] Task fetching from database
   - [x] Session management
   - [x] Cookie handling
   - [x] Basic error handling

2. **Client-Side**

   - [x] Split-pane layout
   - [x] Resizable panels
   - [x] Content rendering (Markdown, basic KaTeX)
   - [x] Responsive design
   - [x] Timer functionality (Start/Pause/Stop)
   - [x] Modern header

3. **Content Management & Editing**

   - [x] Markdown support (via `react-markdown`)
   - [x] Basic LaTeX math rendering (via `rehype-katex`)
   - [x] Lexical editor foundation (`AnswerArea.tsx`)
   - [x] Custom `LatexNode` for representing LaTeX in Lexical.
   - [x] External MathLive (`<math-field>`) integration for LaTeX input.
   - [x] `!!` trigger to open MathLive for inserting _new_ LaTeX nodes.
   - [ ] Click-to-edit existing `LatexNode`s (partially implemented, needs verification).

4. **User Interface**
   - [x] Clean, modern design
   - [x] Timer controls visible in header
   - [x] Responsive layout basics
   - [x] Panel resizing
   - [x] FontAwesome icons
