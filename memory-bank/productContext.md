# Product Context: Assignment Submission Handler

## Purpose

The Assignment Submission Handler provides a streamlined platform for students to view and submit assignments, with special attention to mathematical content rendering, time tracking, and user experience. It aims to simplify the assignment submission process while maintaining proper tracking and security.

## Problems Solved

1. **Assignment Management**

   - Centralized task viewing and submission
   - Secure assignment tracking
   - Proper session handling
   - Mathematical content support
   - Time tracking and management

2. **User Experience**

   - CSS Grid-based split-pane interface for stable reference
   - Resizable panels for flexible layout (handle needs verification)
   - Independent panel scrolling for managing long content
   - Mathematical content rendering
   - Timer controls for time management
   - Modern, intuitive header design

3. **Content Handling**

   - Markdown support for rich text
   - LaTeX math rendering
   - Efficient LaTeX input via MathLive using `!!` and `Ctrl+Q` triggers
   - Editor disabling during math input prevents accidental text changes
   - Single MathLive instance prevents user confusion
   - Proper text formatting
   - Responsive layout basics

## User Experience Goals

1. **Assignment Viewing**

   - Clear task display
   - Mathematical content rendering
   - Easy navigation
   - Responsive layout
   - Time tracking visibility

2. **Submission Process**

   - Simple submission interface
   - Multiple intuitive ways to insert math equations (`!!`, `Ctrl+Q`)
   - Clear feedback when attempting conflicting actions (e.g., opening second MathLive instance)
   - Prevent accidental edits while math input is active (editor disabled)
   - Session persistence
   - Error handling
   - Time management controls

3. **Content Management**

   - Rich text support
   - Mathematical notation display
   - Streamlined equation input/editing via MathLive
   - Format preservation

4. **Visual Design**

   - Clean, modern interface
   - Stable CSS Grid split-pane layout
   - Resizable panels (handle needs verification)
   - Independent panel scrolling
   - Responsive design basics
   - Intuitive timer controls
   - Professional header design

## User Workflow

1. **Assignment Access**

   - User authenticates
   - Assignment ID is set
   - Task is fetched
   - Content is displayed
   - Timer is available

2. **Task Viewing**

   - Question is shown in left pane, scrolls independently with left-side scrollbar
   - Mathematical content renders
   - Panel is resizable (handle needs verification)
   - Timer controls are accessible

3. **Submission Process**

   - Answer is entered in right pane (scrolls independently)
   - Use `!!` or `Ctrl+Q` to open MathLive for equations
   - Only one MathLive input active at a time (focuses existing on conflict)
   - Editor is disabled while MathLive is active
   - Content is formatted
   - Submission is tracked
   - Status is updated
   - Time is recorded

4. **Time Management**

   - Start timer when ready
   - Pause timer when needed
   - Stop timer to reset
   - View elapsed time
   - Track total time spent
