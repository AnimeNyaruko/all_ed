# Active Context: Assignment Submission Handler

## Current Focus

- Completing `update mode` including Memory Bank update and Git operations.

## Recent Changes

- **Update Mode Step 1 (Scan, Propose, Implement):**
  - Code scan (refactor, optimize, lint) performed.
  - No refactoring or optimization changes were deemed necessary or implemented.
  - Lint check passed with no errors. No lint fixes were applied.
- **Previous (before this "update mode" cycle, carried over from `re-update mode 2`):**
    - **Refactor (`lambai.tsx`):**
        - Extracted panel resizing logic (state, refs, handlers, effect) into a new custom hook `app/lambai/(UI)/hooks/usePanelResizer.ts`.
        - Updated `lambai.tsx` to import and use the `usePanelResizer` hook.
    - **Linting:** Passed lint checks after refactoring.
    - **Fix Mode (before `re-update mode 2`):** Fixed the header toggle arrow bug for new users.

## Next Steps

- Proceed with `update mode` Step 3: Git Commit & Push.
- Draft Git commit message for this `update mode` run.
- Present commit message for approval.
- Await Git execution and timestamp.
- Update `version.json`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The refactoring (extraction of `usePanelResizer`) improves the organization of `lambai.tsx`.
- The header toggle issue (fixed in a prior mode) was due to initial height not being available for new users.
- The current `update mode` cycle has not introduced new code changes yet.

## Known Issues (Carried Over)

- **Smoothness:** Interaction might feel slightly less immediate due to the restored `setTimeout` in `useMathLiveManager`.
- **Click-to-Edit:** Not fully implemented/verified for `LatexNode`.
- **Styling:** Visual styling for `LatexNode` is pending.
- **MathLive Initial Display:** Potential rendering issue due to parent overflow (requires testing).
- **`LatexPluginContext` Redundancy:** Context might be unnecessary.
